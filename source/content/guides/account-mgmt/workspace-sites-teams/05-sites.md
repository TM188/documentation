This guide is specific to sites management, not developing and launching sites.

## Creating Sites

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

Be sure to set up workspaces before creating sites.

</Alert>

<Partial file="create-new-site-new-dash.md" />

For more information on site creation, see [Creating Sites](/docs/guides/legacy-dashboard/create-sites)

## Using the Sites Tab

The Sites tab shows all sites this workspace has access to. You can quickly tag, sort, and filter your sites. All of the people in the organization will have access to all of the sites. You can add users to specific sites by checking the box to select the site and clicking **Team** > **Add to Team**.

Agency organizations will show "Site Owners" instead of "Users in Charge"

A **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-snowflake" style="color:#0a6bb5"></span>** icon in the site's status column indicates that a site is [frozen due to inactivity](/guides/platform-considerations/platform-site-info#inactive-site-freezing).

### Associate a Site to a Workspace

If you did not select a workspace when creating the site, you can add it to a workspace later. See [Add Supporting Organization to Site](/docs/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams#add-supporting-organization-to-site).

### Tagging Sites

Tags are an easy way to add data to your sites to help you manage them. 

To add tags to a site:

1. On the **Sites** tab, select one or more sites.

1. Select **Tags**, then select **Add Tags**.

1. Enter the tags you wish to associate to this site, separated by commas, and click Add Tags.

To remove tags from a site:

1. On the **Sites** tab, select one or more sites.

1. Select **Tags**, then select **Remove Tags**.

1. Select the tags you wish to remove, then click **Remove Tags**.

### Exporting a List of Sites

You can export a list of sites to CSV.  Data in the CSV file includes Site Name, date created, owner, upstream, plan and status.

To export a list of files:

1. On the **Sites** tab, find and select the files you wish to include in the list, or select the checkbox at the top of the list to select all sites.

1.Click **More Actions**, then **Export as CSV**.  A file is generated and downloaded to your browserâ€™s download location.

### Changing Site Ownership

The permission to manage a site's plan is granted only to the roles of **Site Owner** / **Organization Administrator**. Other roles do not have access to change the site plan as described on this page. For details, see [Role-Based Permissions & Change Management](/change-management/#site-level-roles-and-permissions).

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If you need to assume site and billing ownership, the current Site Owner must [transfer it to you directly](/guides/legacy-dashboard/site-billing#transfer-ownership-and-billing-for-this-site).

</Alert>

Site ownership is assigned to the person who creates the site or pays for the site. The site owner cannot be removed from the site team.

#### Sandbox Sites

<Partial file="transfer-ownership-billing-steps.md" />

#### Paid Sites

To change the owner of a paid site (e.g. Basic, or Performance):

1. Open the Site Dashboard for the site.

1. Select **Settings**, the **Invite a business owner to pay for this site**.

1. Enter the email address for the new site owner.

   Once the new owner receives the invitation they will be directed to provide payment information, at which point they will assume ownership of the site and will receive future invoices.

Enterprise Organizations can use the same process to assume ownership of a site; however, Agency Partners do not have the ability to own sites directly.


## Deleting Sites

At some point, you may need or want to delete one of your sites on Pantheon. The number of free sites you can create is increased after a free site is deleted, or after it has converted to a paid plan.

Only the site's "User in Charge" or "Owner" can delete a site. See [Roles and Permissions](/change-management#roles-and-permissions) for more information.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

This action is permanent and irreversible. Export any needed content, code, or files from the site before starting this operation.

**Before you delete a site**: Downgrade the site plan to Sandbox. See [Manage Site Plans](/guides/legacy-dashboard/site-plan) for more information.

**After you delete a site that had a live domain or subdomain**: Update the DNS records so that they don't continue to point to the deleted site.

</Alert>


### Delete a site from the Site Dashboard

1. Open the Site Dashboard for the site.

1. Select **Settings** > **Delete Site**.

1. Click the **Delete Site** button.

1. Enter the site title; this ensures you're aware of the site you're deleting.

1. Click **Delete This Site**.

### Delete a site from a Workspace

1. Go to the Professional Workspace containing the site.

1. Select the checkbox next to the site(s) you want to delete.

1. Click **More Actions**, then **Delete Site**.

1. Type **Delete**.

1. Click **Delete Site(s)**.

### Delete a Site with Terminus

Run the following [Terminus](/terminus) command, replacing `<site>` with your site's name:

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus site:delete <site>
```

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

You can see a list of all your sites by running `terminus site:list`.

</Alert>
