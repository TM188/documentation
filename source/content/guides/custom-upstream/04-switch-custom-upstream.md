This section provides steps to switch an existing site's Custom Upstream to a different Custom Upstream.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

Switching the upstream of an existing site is risky. It is safer to create a new site from your Custom Upstream and migrate the contents. [Back up](/backups) your site first and consider our documentation on [upstream merge conflicts](/core-updates/#apply-upstream-updates-manually-from-the-command-line-to-resolve-merge-conflicts) if you must switch upstreams.

</Alert>

## Switch Your Custom Upstream

Review the [Terminus Switch Upstream example](/guides/terminus/examples#switch-upstreams) before following the steps below to switch your Custom Upstream.

1. Run the command below to locate your Custom Upstream's machine name, replacing `$org` with your organization name.
    
    ```bash
    terminus org:upstream:list $org
    ```

1. Run the command below to change the upstream, setting or replacing the variables `$site` and `$upstream_id` with your site name and upstream machine name, respectively.

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    terminus site:upstream:set $site $upstream_id
    ```
