Workspaces are a home base for your WebOps.  There are two types of workspaces:

<dl>
    <dt>Personal Workspace</dt>
    <dd>The personal workspace displays tools for the sites to which you have access, your account tier, and billing for sites you own.  You have only one personal workspace.  We cover this workspace in the [Accounts](docs/guides/account-mgmt/account) guide.</dd>
    <dt>Professional Workspace</dt>
    <dd>Professional workspaces bring together users, sites, Custom Upstreams, Multidev, and support to provide administrators with the tools needed to effectively manage a large number of sites. You may be a part of no workspaces, or many workspaces, depending on your company setup.</dd>

## Create a Workspace

The following process will create a Silver workspace. For additional collaboration tools such as Multidev and visual regression testing, upgrade to a Gold workspace.

If you are creating the Workspace for a web agency, you will be assigned a [Partner Trial Tier](https://pantheon.io/plans/partner-program). If the Workspace is not for an agency, you will be assigned a [Silver Tier Workspace](https://pantheon.io/plans/pricing).

You can create as many workspaces as necessary for your organization. 

To create a Professional Workspace:

1. Select your gravatar in the upper left corner, then select **Create New Workspace**.

1. Enter the information, and optionally, upload a logo, for the workspace, and click **Continue**.

1. You now have the option to invite team members.  You can skip this step by clicking **Continue**.


## Switch Between Workspaces

If you're a member of multiple [Organizations](/organizations), you can stay logged in, and switch between Workspaces to work on different projects.

Click your gravatar upper left to switch between Workspaces:

## Customize a Workspace

You can customize the following for a Workspace

- The name and icon of the organization workspace.
  
- Add optional payment and terms of service information for Sites built in your Workspace.

To customize a Professional Workspace, go to the Workspace you wish to customize, then click the **Settings** tab.

## Delete a Workspace

Workspaces cannot be deleted.
