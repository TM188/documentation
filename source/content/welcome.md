## Dashboard

To get started with your dashboard:

* [Log in to your Pantheon account, then go to the Workspace tab](https://dashboard.pantheon.io).
* [Learn about your Professional Workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces#the-organization-dashboard).
* [Review workspace-level roles and permissions](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams#roles-and-permissions).

## Create a New Site, or Migrate Your Existing Site

[Create a new site from your workspace dashboard](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#create-a-site), or migrate an existing site from…

* [Acquia](/guides/acquia/)
* [Kinsta](/guides/kinsta/)
* [Pagely](/guides/pagely/)
* [Platform.sh](/guides/platformsh/)
* [WordPress VIP](/guides/wordpressvip/)
* [WP Engine](/guides/wpengine/)
* [Anywhere else](/guides/guided/)

## Launch Your Site

First, [upgrade your site plan](/site-plan) by clicking the yellow Upgrade button in the site dashboard.

Next, perform your launch check:
* [WordPress](/wordpress-launch-check)
* [Drupal](/drupal-launch-check)

[Finally, go live](/guides/launch/).

## Multidev

Gold-level support or above gives your organization-level members access to Multidev. Multidev is a development environment for teams and allows a developer to fork the entire stack (code and content), work independently, then merge the code changes back into the master branch. Each forked branch will have its own separate development environment, including database and files.

* [Learn more about Multidev](/multidev)

## New Relic: Application Performance Monitoring

On Pantheon, most plans—except Basic—come with free New Relic APM Pro, giving you code-level visibility into your website’s performance. Once activated on your site, you can track releases, investigate query performance, and identify areas for improvement with the best-in-class software analytics tool suite. 

* [Learn more about New Relic](https://pantheon.io/features/new-relic)
* [Learn how to activate New Relic](/new-relic/).

## Apache Solr

Apache Solr is a system for indexing and searching site content. All plans except for a Basic plan can use Solr. Solr is available to Sandbox site plans for developmental purposes, but Solr will not be available going live on a Basic plan. No permission or action is required from Pantheon to use Solr. 

* [Learn how to enable Apache Solr](/solr)

## Redis

Redis can accelerate your site’s internal operations through application object caching. This can significantly accelerate dynamic page generation and the logged-in user experience. All plans except for the Basic plan can use Redis. Sandbox site plans can enable and use Redis for developmental purposes, but if the site plan is upgraded to Basic, the feature will be disabled. No permission or action is required from Pantheon to use Redis. 

* [Learn how to enable Redis](/redis)
