## Product and Features Updates

### New Dashboard

Previously, users with the Unprivileged role were not able to create sites using Custom Upstreams. Users with the Unprivileged role do not possess permissions to access the Workspace Dashboard and could not create sites using Custom Upstreams. Now, it's possible to create a site using a Custom Upstream from the Personal Workspace in the New Dashboard. Click **Create New Site** and then select **Upstream From Workspace**.   


## Documentation

[Quicksilver on Pantheon](/guides/quicksilver) - Documentation on Quicksilver is now available in an accessible guide. Quicksilver hooks into platform workflows to automate your Pantheon WebOps workflow. This allows the platform to run selected scripts automatically every hour, or when a team member triggers the corresponding workflow.
