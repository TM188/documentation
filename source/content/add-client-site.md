[Partner Agencies](https://pantheon.io/plans/partner-program?docs) on Pantheon receive additional levels of support and [Preferred Pricing](https://pantheon.io/plans/agency-preferred-pricing?docs) for themselves and their clients. This doc explains how to share those benefits by adding a client's site to your Agency.

While many of these steps are followed through the normal course of an Agency-Client relationship. We've collected them here as a quick reference.
