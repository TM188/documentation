The permission to transfer ownership or update payment method is granted only to the role of **Site Owner**. You can see who is assigned the role of Site Owner by clicking **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Team** in the Site Dashboard. Other roles do not have access to billing as described on this page.

## Transfer Ownership
