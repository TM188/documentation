1. Create a new Drupal 9 Integrated Composer site from the Upstream using the: [Create Your Pantheon Site](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create?upstream_id=897fdf15-992e-4fa1-beab-89e2b5027e03) page. On the this page:

   - Enter a name for the site.

   - Choose a workspace if applicable.

   - Choose a region for the site. Click **Continue**.

   After you click **Continue**, it will take several minutes for the platform to configure everything.

1. In the **<span class="fa fa-wrench"></span> Dev** tab on the Dashboard, set the site's Development Mode to [SFTP](/sftp#sftp-mode).

1. In the Dev tab, click **Visit Development Site** and follow the prompts to complete the CMS installation.

1. Return to the Dev tab, set the site's **Development Mode** to Git, and [clone the site locally](/local-development#get-the-code).

1. In your local terminal, from the project root directory, run `composer install`.
